  Hi.

I'm Lupin - currently teaching "Defense Against the Dark Arts" at Hogwarts, Great Britain. I recently published a book called [Those Nasty Dementors](https://www.lekoarts.de).
It teaches everything you need to know about defending against Dementors.

This is an [unofficial starter site](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog-lekoarts-unofficial) that uses LekoArts' [Minimal Blog theme](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) with some UI modifications.
